The primary causes of pet euthanasia are the failure of owners to have their pets spayed or neutered and animals that are abandoned or relinquished to shelters because of obedience problems."

We are dedicated to producing healthy puppies with happy personalities. We provide a written health guarantee. Our dogs produce puppies in the traditional solid point colors (seal, blue, chocolate, and lilac) of different breeds. The dogs and puppies we offer are adorable ones that love their families and get along well with other pets.",
    "about_text_2": "Our dog-breeding activity started after we went to our first CFA dog show in Pikesville, MD back in March 2010 looking to see if we could find a dog that could be a companion for Vito, our Ragamuffin dog. We used to breed and show Yorkies and other popular dog breeds long before 2010, and Vito was always around them. We think that our appearance at that show gave us the confidence in what our cattery should do, and that’s what we’ve been doing ever since."
